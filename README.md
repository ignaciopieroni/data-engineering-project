# Data Engineering Project Using Python
In this project, we'll work with real-world data using Python to obtain it<br>
directly from a webpage using Web Scraping techniques, transforming the data<br>
to meet the given requirements, and saving it as a local file as a table in a database.<br>
We will also run basic queries on that database using Python.<br>
<br>
Basic concepts of the <strong>ETL (extract-transform-load)</strong> process will be applied, extracting<br>
the required information using <strong>Web Scraping</strong> and <strong>APIs</strong>, developing a functional<br>
<strong>ETL Pipeline</strong> for the stages of data acquisition and processing of ingested data in multiple formats<br>
from a piblic domain.<br>
<br>
Finally, we will create modules, run unit tests, <strong>Package Applications</strong>, and perform a <strong>Static Code<br>
Analysis</strong> also using Python.

<h2>Project Scenario</h2>
Our job is to access and process data as per requirements.

We are asked to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, we need to transform the data and store it in USD, GBP, EUR, and INR per the exchange rate information made available to me as a CSV file. We'll save the processed information as a table, locally in a CSV format and as a database table. Provide the data ready for queries for extracing the list and note the market capitalization value in their own currency.
